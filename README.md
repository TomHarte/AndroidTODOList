Android TODO List
=================

This project is an absolutely trivial TODO list for Android, implementing a persistent list of strings which you can add to, remove from or edit any single item of.

It's two very simple activities, one of which largely came from a CodePath tutorial and the second was self-written in order hopefully to evidence my suitability for the eight-week Android course.

I also factored out the list itself to a model object based on being unaware until later that activities can return results. That's how fresh I am. In any case it doesn't encapsulate its data particularly well owing to my inexperience with adaptors, the course being limited in total size and the potential implicit first-come-first-serve nature of spots.
